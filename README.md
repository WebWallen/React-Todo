# React To Do List App

I know... you've seen a thousand to-do list apps. But several smart people say they're one of the easiest ways to get comfortable with a different syntax or coding language. Thus, this felt like a good way to learn how class components work.

State hooks are quickly replacing class components, but I imagine you'll still see this syntax in the wild, since it would be difficult to refactor a large codebase as soon as one tradition rises up to replace another one. So this app was good practice just to be safe!

## How the App Works

- Type a new "to-do" in the text box and click the "Add New Task" button to (you guessed it) add a new task.
- Cross off to-do items by clicking on them (they should turn red, which means the class name changed to "complete").
- Clear all of the accomplished to-do's by clicking on the "Clear Completed Tasks" button (which causes them to vanish).
